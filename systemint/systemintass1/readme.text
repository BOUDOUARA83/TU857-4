This is an overview of how the code works 

Accept domains passed as command line arguments: Yes, the code accepts a domain as a command-line argument.

Send valid DNS requests: The code constructs a DNS query, sends it to a DNS server, and receives the response, which covers this requirement.

Receive and parse the DNS response: The code receives and parses the DNS response using the read_datagram function and processes the answers.

Support for both IPv4 and IPv6: The code makes two separate requests, one for IPv4 (A QTYPE) and another for IPv6 (AAAA QTYPE). It processes and displays the results for both IP versions.

Human-readable output: The code provides human-readable output for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
as well as for canonical names. IPv4 addresses are displayed as four unsigned decimal numbers separated by dots, 
IPv6 addresses are displayed in the required format, and canonical names are displayed as domains separated by dots
